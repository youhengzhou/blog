Often as children we were taught that knowledge is power and we should strive to read as often as we can. And although it may seem counterintuitive at first, the more we read, the worse the quality of our thoughts become. This is because when we train our brains to adapt to a passive activity such as reading, we gradually lose the ability for our brain to think for itself. Even as we try to think for ourselves, we fall back to regurgitating truths we remembered from books, and we stumble when we encounter new problems we must give solutions to that we have never seen from books. Instead, we should try to learn fundamental truths and practice deriving answers from first principles, to ensure we can solve any problems that we encounter.

Books are a great source of information and research tool to save time for the reader and tap into years of research, wisdom, and knowledge from the author. But the practice of reading is not a familiar task for many people. Most people today dislike reading and prefer to spend their leisurely hours talking or texting with their friends. This is because the act of sitting down to read is difficult and must be practiced. To practice reading, one must learn to sit still and forget about their own wandering thoughts to fully focus on the text in front of them. This act of sitting still for perhaps hours at a time to read through a book, often times hundred pages long may come as unnatural to many beginner readers. Consequentially, as a reader practices the art of reading and sitting still for long periods of time, they lose their ability to have wandering thoughts as they begin to prefer listening to the thoughts of others rather create than their own thoughts. This leads to a problem of readers becoming unoriginal thinkers who prefer to hear the thoughts of others rather than create their own opinions and have their own thoughts.

It would be fine and dandy if there were books written for every problem and the reader could find and read a book for every problem they had. But often times many problems are either not straight forward to have books written for them or even if there are, the reader cannot guarantee they could find every book they need for every problem they encounter in a timely manner. For example, if an avid reader walked into an interview and their boss asked them a technical question that that they did not prepare for, and expected them to rely on their technical fundamentals to brainstorm a solution to the problem on the spot. The reader would struggle in this situation if they trained their brain to be overly reliant on regurgitating past knowledge from books instead of training their brain to think on the spot or derive information from first principles.

When we train our brains to be fluid and practice deriving solutions from first principles, we can better ensure we come up with solutions to the problems and challenges we may encounter in life. Elon Musk famously practices this philosophy to run his successful companies such as SpaceX and Tesla. For decades, it is believed spaceflight is an industry reserved for global superpowers such as America and the European Union, and civilian spaceflight companies wouldn't be able to sustain themselves in such a cutting edge and demanding field. But using the thought framework of deriving solutions from first principles, Musk was able to successfully create a civilian spaceflight company called SpaceX to take on contracts for NASA and send humans to space. Musk encountered many challenges along the way towards creating SpaceX, as there was no precedent and no books written on how to create a civilian spaceflight company. The only way for Musk to pioneer and become the first civilian spaceflight company was to think for himself and come up with innovative solutions using the framework of breaking down the complex challenges he encountered into first principles.

It was through being a fluid and independent thinker and not through reading insurmountable number books that Musk was able to create the first successful civilian spaceflight company on this planet. And similarly, for ordinary people with more banal challenges, we should also strive to become fluid thinkers who could adapt to dynamic situations with creative solutions over becoming rigid book readers and memorizers. For the simple fact that we cannot memorize an infinite number of books and there are not an infinite number of books written for the infinite types of exciting problems and challenges that we could face in the future. We also cannot predict the problems that we might face in the future. The only thing we could do to prepare for those challenges are to train ourselves to be fluid and flexible thinkers who could tackle anything that comes our way.

## summary of points

- we become listeners more than thinkers

- we rely on books and outside system for truths than our own thoughts

- we should use first principles and flexible thinking instead
