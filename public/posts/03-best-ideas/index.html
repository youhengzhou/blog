I took this topic from the GRE practice and sample essays booklet: The best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things.\nAnd I promise you I had only briefly looked at the first 3 lines on the official solution for a level 6 essay, before realizing my conversational/stream of consciousness vocabulary was not up to par.\nBut I still decided to give it a go and see how I do, and here is what I came up with, after some light (non-existent) edits.\nMy Essay Good ideas have many metrics at how they are measured. Some can measure good ideas by their economical value, scientific value, and so on. But it is for certain that the best ideas all seem to arise from a strong sense of passion by its creator. And usually that passion develops from the creator’s childhood passion in commonplace things.\nDifficult ideas such as quantum mechanics and relativity are not so difficult if information regarding their prerequisites were understood in depth and taught in a comprehensive manner. Once difficult concepts such as calculus and newtonian physics are now being taught in elementary school settings now that we have a much stronger understanding of the fundamental knowledge of those concepts such as basic arithmetics and algebra.\nBut this wasn’t always the case. Back in the middle ages and even up to Newton’s own enlightenment era, only select monks in monasteries and affluent aristocrats were taught educated in basic algebra and arithmetics. For the general populace, they were not taught.\nSo in the case without these fundamental knowledge, how might a great idea be conceived? It is through a combination of passion and curiosity in analyzing commonplace things, which builds up the inventor’s fundamental knowledge so they can produce great ideas that seems trivial in hindsight.\nIn a sense, coming up with good ideas is connecting the dots between a series of commonplace knowledge. But you also cannot simply find the lines even if you have knowledge of the dots without much trial and error. And this is where passion comes in. Passion is the necessary fuel for the creator to keep trying in the face of adversity, to try and connect the dots even if it means failing a lot of times. As Edison famously invented the lightbulb after 1000 unsuccessful attempts, a great idea needs the creator to have the passion and resilience to endure failures.\nIn conclusion, a great idea often arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things because to invent a new idea it often takes passion to resist giving up in the face of failure and also strong fundamental knowledge that are building blocks for the new idea.\nMy Own Analysis My first honest opinion after finishing the essay was proud that I managed to stuck through and finished it even though at various point I wanted to leave and revise my strategy for writing an essay like this. The reasoning is at some point during the second paragraph I realized my explanatory paragraphs were going off topic (a recurring theme in my blogs I imagine) and I had to go back and revise just slightly to keep the examples I had conjured up (Newton and how Calculus was once considered cutting edge but no longer now that we have better understanding of the fundamentals of Calculus). And it sort of related to the topic which was partly about “commonplace things”.\nBut alas, I wanted to just see if I could do it, as in, finish the task in one stream of consciousness take, so I proceeded, shutting off that part of my brain of the self critic and kept chugging along.\nIf I have to go back and give myself advice before starting, it would be to take a nap, drink lots of water, read the topic carefully, sit down and think/write the skeleton of the essay first before starting.\nIn all seriousness, planning with a skeleton for such a type of constrained analytical essay is super important I imagine.\nBut that’s enough with my own opinions, let’s see what Bing chat has to say, in the year 2023, September 24.\nBing Chat (Precise Version) This is a well-written essay with a clear argument and good use of examples. Here’s how I would rate it on the GRE scale:\nIssue Task: 5/6\nArticulation of complex ideas and effective support for claims: The essay does a good job of presenting complex ideas in a clear and accessible way. The use of examples, such as the development of quantum mechanics and relativity, and the story of Edison’s invention of the lightbulb, effectively support the main argument.\nFocused and coherent discussion: The essay maintains a clear focus on the topic and develops the argument in a logical and coherent manner.\nCommand of written English and syntactic variety: The essay demonstrates a strong command of written English. There is good use of syntactic variety, with a mix of simple and complex sentences.\nMinor errors in grammar, punctuation, or spelling: There are a few minor errors in the essay, but they do not significantly interfere with the clarity of the argument.\nRemember, this is just an evaluation and the actual GRE raters might have a slightly different opinion. Keep practicing and refining your writing skills! 😊\nMy Thoughts on Bing Chat (Precise Version) I was honestly surprised at the score. I think it was too high. 5/6 wasn’t too bad from the comments of GRE analytical essays on Reddit. People were planning and studying for months to aim for a score like 5/6, and from other people’s opinions, like the sheep in this situation, I was happy with a 5/6 as long as other people were with 5/6’s. To be fair I had little to no idea what 5/6 represented exactly. I had also only briefly skimmed the GRE analytical essay example document and saw maybe at most 4 or 5 words of that particular 5/6 sample essay.\nBut alas, I moved on with Bing Chat, the better version which I thought would do better with wordy tasks such as writing an essay.\nBing Chat (Creative Version) Sure, I can try to rate your essay using the GRE scale. According to the GRE website1, the Analytical Writing measure tests your critical thinking and analytical writing skills. It assesses your ability to articulate and support complex ideas, construct and evaluate arguments, and sustain a focused and coherent discussion. It does not assess specific content knowledge.\nThe Analytical Writing measure consists of two separately timed analytical writing tasks:\nA 30-minute “Analyze an Issue” task A 30-minute “Analyze an Argument” task The Issue task presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You are required to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views.\nThe Argument task requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.\nThe two tasks are complementary in that one requires you to construct your own argument by taking a position and providing evidence supporting your views on an issue, and the other requires you to evaluate someone else’s argument by assessing its claims and evaluating the evidence it provides.\nEach essay is scored on a scale of 0-6 by at least one trained reader and by a computer program called e-rater. The scores are then averaged to produce a final score for each task. If the human and e-rater scores differ by more than one point, a second human reader is brought in to resolve the discrepancy.\nThe scoring for the essay is holistic, which means that graders base scores on an overall impression of your essay, rather than deducting specific points for errors. The score level descriptions for the Analytical Writing measure are as follows1:\nScore 6: Outstanding. Demonstrates superior analytical writing skills. Score 5: Strong. Demonstrates clear competence in analytical writing skills. Score 4: Adequate. Demonstrates satisfactory analytical writing skills. Score 3: Limited. Demonstrates some competence in analytical writing skills, but with weaknesses. Score 2: Seriously flawed. Demonstrates serious weaknesses in analytical writing skills. Score 1: Fundamentally deficient. Demonstrates fundamental deficiencies in analytical writing skills. Score 0: Unscorable. The essay is off-topic, written in a foreign language, consists of keystroke characters or merely copies the topic. Based on these criteria, I would rate your essay as follows:\nScore for the Issue task: 4 Score for the Argument task: N/A (not attempted) Your essay on the Issue task demonstrates adequate analytical writing skills. You have presented a clear and coherent position on the topic and supported it with relevant reasons and examples. You have also considered some complexities and implications of the issue. However, your essay could be improved by addressing some of the following points: Your introduction could be more engaging and provide more context for the issue. You could also state your thesis more explicitly and preview your main points.\nYour body paragraphs could be more organized and focused on one main idea each. You could also use more transitions and topic sentences to connect your ideas and guide your reader.\nYour conclusion could be more effective by summarizing your main points, restating your thesis, and providing some implications or recommendations for further action or research on the issue.\nYour language could be more precise and varied. You could avoid repetition, use synonyms, and choose words that convey your meaning more accurately and effectively.\nYour grammar, spelling, and punctuation could be more accurate and consistent. You could proofread your essay carefully and correct any errors or typos.\nI hope this feedback helps you improve your analytical writing skills. Thank you for using Bing! 😊\nMy Thoughts on Bing Chat (Creative Version) So right off the bat, seeing a 4/6, and feeling uncharacteristically confident, coming off that dopamine high point to a more realistic trough of 4/6, it kinda stung a little bit, even though I knew deep inside that 5/6 was undeserved.\nBecause I didn’t really put in much work for it.\nAnd wouldn’t that be a better story? Through the years of practicing my writing skills, I was able to effortlessly take my journaling/stream of consciousness writing skills to transition into the field of analytical writing.\nBut it seems focused practice still beats generalist practice and knowledge.\nAnyways, I agreed with Bing Chat (Creative Version)’s statements about my essay.\nAnd I don’t want to comment too much here because there’s more.\nAsking Bing Chat (Creative Version) to Edit My Essay Sure, I can try to help you edit your essay to be 6/6. Here are some suggestions for improving your essay:\nTo make your introduction more engaging and provide more context for the issue, you could start with a hook that captures the reader’s attention and relates to the topic. For example, you could use a quote, a statistic, a question, or an anecdote that illustrates the importance of passion and curiosity in generating good ideas. You could also provide some background information on the issue, such as why it is relevant, controversial, or debatable. You could also state your thesis more explicitly and preview your main points. For example, you could say something like:\n“The most powerful weapon is not a gun or a bomb, but an idea. Ideas have the potential to change the world, but where do they come from? How do people come up with good ideas that solve problems, create innovations, and inspire others? Some people might think that good ideas are the result of genius, luck, or inspiration. However, I believe that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. In this essay, I will explain why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas, how they help overcome challenges and difficulties, and how they lead to positive outcomes and impacts.” To make your body paragraphs more organized and focused on one main idea each, you could use the following structure:\nTopic sentence: Introduce the main idea of the paragraph and how it supports your thesis.\nExplanation: Explain the main idea in more detail and provide examples or evidence.\nAnalysis: Analyze how the examples or evidence support your main idea and connect it to your thesis.\nTransition: Connect the main idea of the paragraph to the next one.\nFor example, you could write something like:\n“One reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help build fundamental knowledge and skills that are necessary for creative thinking. Passion is the motivation that drives people to learn more about their interests and hobbies, while curiosity is the desire to explore new possibilities and questions. By pursuing their passions and curiosities, people can acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to different domains and situations. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was passionate about painting, but he was also curious about anatomy, engineering, astronomy, and many other fields. He used his diverse knowledge and skills to create masterpieces of art and science that are still admired today. His passion and curiosity enabled him to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics and generate original and innovative ideas. Therefore, passion and curiosity are important for developing the foundation for good ideas.” To make your conclusion more effective by summarizing your main points, restating your thesis, and providing some implications or recommendations for further action or research on the issue, you could use the following structure:\nSummary: Summarize the main points of your essay and how they support your thesis.\nRestatement: Restate your thesis in different words and emphasize its significance.\nImplications: Discuss the implications or consequences of your thesis for the issue or for society in general.\nRecommendations: Provide some suggestions or advice for how to foster passion and curiosity in oneself or others.\nFor example, you could write something like:\n“In conclusion, I have argued that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. Passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas because they help build fundamental knowledge and skills, overcome challenges and difficulties, and lead to positive outcomes and impacts. Passion and curiosity are not innate traits that only some people possess, but rather habits of mind that can be cultivated and practiced by anyone. Therefore, I recommend that people should follow their passions and curiosities wherever they lead them, seek new experiences and perspectives, ask questions and challenge assumptions, and share their ideas with others. By doing so, they will not only enrich their own lives, but also contribute to the advancement of humanity.” To make your language more precise and varied, you could avoid repetition by using synonyms or pronouns when appropriate. You could also choose words that convey your meaning more accurately and effectively by using specific nouns instead of vague ones, using adjectives or adverbs to modify nouns or verbs, using transitions or conjunctions to show relationships between ideas, using active voice instead of passive voice when possible, etc. For example: Instead of saying “good ideas” repeatedly throughout your essay, you could use synonyms such as “creative ideas”, “innovative ideas”, “original ideas”, etc.\nInstead of saying “commonplace things” repeatedly throughout your essay, you could use specific examples such as “painting”, “anatomy”, “engineering”, etc.\nInstead of saying “difficult concepts” repeatedly throughout your essay, you could use adjectives such as “complex”, “abstract”, “challenging”, etc.\nInstead of saying “passion” repeatedly throughout your essay, you could use pronouns such as “it”, “this”, “that”, etc. when referring to the same idea.\nInstead of saying “it often takes passion” in your third paragraph, you could say “it usually requires passion” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nInstead of saying “to invent a new idea” in your third paragraph, you could say “to create a novel idea” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nInstead of saying “passion is the necessary fuel” in your third paragraph, you could say “passion is the essential driving force” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nInstead of saying “in the face of adversity” in your third paragraph, you could say “despite numerous obstacles” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nInstead of saying “as Edison famously invented the lightbulb after 1000 unsuccessful attempts” in your third paragraph, you could say “as Edison famously demonstrated with his invention of the lightbulb after 1000 failed trials” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nInstead of saying “a great idea needs the creator to have the passion and resilience to endure failures” in your third paragraph, you could say “a great idea demands that the creator possesses passion and resilience to withstand failures” to avoid repetition and show variation.\nTo make your grammar, spelling, and punctuation more accurate and consistent, you could proofread your essay carefully and correct any errors or typos. For example: In your first paragraph, you should capitalize “Quantum Mechanics” and “Relativity” as they are proper nouns.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “in depth” and before “and taught”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “calculus” and before “and newtonian physics”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should capitalize “Newtonian Physics” as it is a proper noun.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “elementary school settings” and before “now that”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “middle ages” and before “and even up”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “Newton’s own enlightenment era” and before “only select”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “monks in monasteries” and before “and affluent”.\nIn your first paragraph, you should use a comma after “aristocrats were taught educated in basic algebra and arithmetics” and before “for the general populace”.\nIn your second paragraph, you should use a comma after “So in the case without these fundamental knowledge” and before “how might”.\nIn your second paragraph, you should use a comma after “It is through a combination of passion and curiosity in analyzing commonplace things” and before “which builds up”.\nIn your second paragraph, you should use a comma after “In a sense” and before “coming up with good ideas”.\nIn your second paragraph, you should use a comma after “And this is where passion comes in” and before “passion is the necessary fuel”.\nIn your second paragraph, you should use a comma after “As Edison famously invented the lightbulb after 1000 unsuccessful attempts” and before “a great idea needs”.\nI hope these suggestions help you improve your essay to be 6.6. Thank you for using Bing! 😊\nGRE Analytical Writing Measure\nHere is the whole edited 6/6 essay:\n\"The most powerful weapon is not a gun or a bomb, but an idea. Ideas have the potential to change the world, but where do they come from? How do people come up with good ideas that solve problems, create innovations, and inspire others? Some people might think that good ideas are the result of genius, luck, or inspiration. However, I believe that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. In this essay, I will explain why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas, how they help overcome challenges and difficulties, and how they lead to positive outcomes and impacts.\rOne reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help build fundamental knowledge and skills that are necessary for creative thinking. Passion is the motivation that drives people to learn more about their interests and hobbies, while curiosity is the desire to explore new possibilities and questions. By pursuing their passions and curiosities, people can acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to different domains and situations. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was passionate about painting, but he was also curious about anatomy, engineering, astronomy, and many other fields. He used his diverse knowledge and skills to create masterpieces of art and science that are still admired today. His passion and curiosity enabled him to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics and generate original and innovative ideas. Therefore, passion and curiosity are important for developing the foundation for good ideas.\rAnother reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help overcome challenges and difficulties that might otherwise discourage or prevent creative thinking. Passion is the fuel that keeps people going in the face of failure, rejection, or criticism, while curiosity is the spark that ignites new ideas and solutions. By having passion and curiosity, people can persist in their endeavors, experiment with different approaches, and learn from their mistakes. For example, Thomas Edison was passionate about inventing, but he was also curious about electricity, light, and sound. He faced many obstacles and failures in his quest to invent the lightbulb, but he never gave up. He tried over 1000 different materials for the filament until he found the right one. His passion and curiosity led him to discover not only the lightbulb, but also many other inventions that changed the world. Thus, passion and curiosity are essential for overcoming the challenges and difficulties of creative thinking.\rA final reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they lead to positive outcomes and impacts that benefit not only the individual, but also society as a whole. Passion is the source of joy and fulfillment that comes from doing what one loves, while curiosity is the source of wonder and excitement that comes from discovering new things. By having passion and curiosity, people can enrich their own lives, as well as contribute to the advancement of humanity. For example, Marie Curie was passionate about science, but she was also curious about radioactivity. She devoted her life to studying this phenomenon, despite the risks and hardships she faced. She made groundbreaking discoveries that revolutionized physics and chemistry, as well as medicine and industry. Her passion and curiosity earned her two Nobel Prizes and a lasting legacy in history. Hence, passion and curiosity are important for creating positive outcomes and impacts from good ideas.\rIn conclusion, I have argued that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. Passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas because they help build fundamental knowledge and skills, overcome challenges and difficulties, and lead to positive outcomes and impacts. Passion and curiosity are not innate traits that only some people possess, but rather habits of mind that can be cultivated and practiced by anyone. Therefore, I recommend that people should follow their passions and curiosities wherever they lead them, seek new experiences and perspectives, ask questions and challenge assumptions, and share their ideas with others. By doing so, they will not only enrich their own lives, but also contribute to the advancement of humanity.\" My Thoughts on Bing Chat (Creative Version)’s Edits Well, not bad. And to be totally truthful, I didn’t read all of it.\nA lot of it were hard to follow back and forth as I didn’t actually remember much of my own writing right as I finished. And Bing Chat, constrained by a text box style output, couldn’t write red exclamations with a pen across my essay paper for me.\nMan I admit I’m afraid of English teachers. They’re so aware of mistakes and perfections, and I can’t argue because I know they’re right.\nI just like writing like I’m talking, making entertainment. How about you judge a piece of writing with how many jokes per line it has? And if it doesn’t hit that number, you write a red line across it. I just don’t like writing things that are correct but boring.\nBut anyways, I asked Bing Chat, the other version to edit my essay.\nBing Chat (Precise Version)’s Edits Sure, I’d be happy to help you refine your essay. Here’s a revised version:\nThe Genesis of Great Ideas: A Passionate Interest in the Commonplace Great ideas are often measured by their economic or scientific value. However, the genesis of these ideas invariably lies in the passionate interest of their creators, often rooted in commonplace things. This passion, coupled with a deep understanding of fundamental concepts, fuels the creation of ideas that may seem trivial in hindsight but are revolutionary in their impact.\nConsider complex theories such as quantum mechanics and relativity. These theories, once considered esoteric, are now more accessible due to our improved understanding of their prerequisites and our ability to teach them comprehensively. Concepts like calculus and Newtonian physics, once the exclusive domain of scholars, are now taught in elementary schools, thanks to our grasp of fundamental knowledge like basic arithmetic and algebra.\nHistorically, this was not always the case. During the Middle Ages and even up to Newton’s era, only select monks in monasteries and affluent aristocrats were educated in basic algebra and arithmetic. The general populace was largely uneducated.\nSo, in the absence of this fundamental knowledge, how might a great idea be conceived? The answer lies in the passionate and curious examination of commonplace things. This passion fuels the inventor’s quest for knowledge, enabling them to connect the dots and produce great ideas.\nIn essence, the process of ideation is akin to connecting the dots between a series of commonplace knowledge. However, even with knowledge of the dots, finding the lines that connect them requires trial and error. This is where passion plays a crucial role. Passion provides the resilience to endure failures and persist in the face of adversity. As Thomas Edison famously said after inventing the lightbulb following 1000 unsuccessful attempts, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 1000 ways that won’t work.”\nIn conclusion, great ideas often arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. This passion, coupled with a strong foundation of fundamental knowledge, enables the creator to endure failures and persevere in their quest for innovation.\nThis revised version maintains the original argument and examples but enhances clarity and coherence.

I took this topic from the GRE practice and sample essays booklet: <code>The best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things</code>.</p><p>And I promise you I had only briefly looked at the first 3 lines on the official solution for a level 6 essay, before realizing my conversational/stream of consciousness vocabulary was not up to par.</p><p>But I still decided to give it a go and see how I do, and here is what I came up with, after some light (non-existent) edits.</p><h2 id=my-essay>My Essay<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-essay>#</a></h2><p>Good ideas have many metrics at how they are measured. Some can measure good ideas by their economical value, scientific value, and so on. But it is for certain that the best ideas all seem to arise from a strong sense of passion by its creator. And usually that passion develops from the creator&rsquo;s childhood passion in commonplace things.</p><p>Difficult ideas such as quantum mechanics and relativity are not so difficult if information regarding their prerequisites were understood in depth and taught in a comprehensive manner. Once difficult concepts such as calculus and newtonian physics are now being taught in elementary school settings now that we have a much stronger understanding of the fundamental knowledge of those concepts such as basic arithmetics and algebra.</p><p>But this wasn&rsquo;t always the case. Back in the middle ages and even up to Newton&rsquo;s own enlightenment era, only select monks in monasteries and affluent aristocrats were taught educated in basic algebra and arithmetics. For the general populace, they were not taught.</p><p>So in the case without these fundamental knowledge, how might a great idea be conceived? It is through a combination of passion and curiosity in analyzing commonplace things, which builds up the inventor&rsquo;s fundamental knowledge so they can produce great ideas that seems trivial in hindsight.</p><p>In a sense, coming up with good ideas is connecting the dots between a series of commonplace knowledge. But you also cannot simply find the lines even if you have knowledge of the dots without much trial and error. And this is where passion comes in. Passion is the necessary fuel for the creator to keep trying in the face of adversity, to try and connect the dots even if it means failing a lot of times. As Edison famously invented the lightbulb after 1000 unsuccessful attempts, a great idea needs the creator to have the passion and resilience to endure failures.</p><p>In conclusion, a great idea often arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things because to invent a new idea it often takes passion to resist giving up in the face of failure and also strong fundamental knowledge that are building blocks for the new idea.</p><h2 id=my-own-analysis>My Own Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-own-analysis>#</a></h2><p>My first honest opinion after finishing the essay was proud that I managed to stuck through and finished it even though at various point I wanted to leave and revise my strategy for writing an essay like this. The reasoning is at some point during the second paragraph I realized my explanatory paragraphs were going off topic (a recurring theme in my blogs I imagine) and I had to go back and revise just slightly to keep the examples I had conjured up (Newton and how Calculus was once considered cutting edge but no longer now that we have better understanding of the fundamentals of Calculus). And it sort of related to the topic which was partly about &ldquo;commonplace things&rdquo;.</p><p>But alas, I wanted to just see if I could do it, as in, finish the task in one stream of consciousness take, so I proceeded, shutting off that part of my brain of the self critic and kept chugging along.</p><p>If I have to go back and give myself advice before starting, it would be to take a nap, drink lots of water, read the topic carefully, sit down and think/write the skeleton of the essay first before starting.</p><p>In all seriousness, planning with a skeleton for such a type of constrained analytical essay is super important I imagine.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s enough with my own opinions, let&rsquo;s see what Bing chat has to say, in the year 2023, September 24.</p><h2 id=bing-chat-precise-version>Bing Chat (Precise Version)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bing-chat-precise-version>#</a></h2><p>This is a well-written essay with a clear argument and good use of examples. Here&rsquo;s how I would rate it on the GRE scale:</p><p><strong>Issue Task: 5/6</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Articulation of complex ideas and effective support for claims:</strong> The essay does a good job of presenting complex ideas in a clear and accessible way. The use of examples, such as the development of quantum mechanics and relativity, and the story of Edison&rsquo;s invention of the lightbulb, effectively support the main argument.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focused and coherent discussion:</strong> The essay maintains a clear focus on the topic and develops the argument in a logical and coherent manner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Command of written English and syntactic variety:</strong> The essay demonstrates a strong command of written English. There is good use of syntactic variety, with a mix of simple and complex sentences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minor errors in grammar, punctuation, or spelling:</strong> There are a few minor errors in the essay, but they do not significantly interfere with the clarity of the argument.</p></li></ul><p>Remember, this is just an evaluation and the actual GRE raters might have a slightly different opinion. Keep practicing and refining your writing skills! 😊</p><h2 id=my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-precise-version>My Thoughts on Bing Chat (Precise Version)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-precise-version>#</a></h2><p>I was honestly surprised at the score. I think it was too high. 5/6 wasn&rsquo;t too bad from the comments of GRE analytical essays on Reddit. People were planning and studying for months to aim for a score like 5/6, and from other people&rsquo;s opinions, like the sheep in this situation, I was happy with a 5/6 as long as other people were with 5/6&rsquo;s. To be fair I had little to no idea what 5/6 represented exactly. I had also only briefly skimmed the GRE analytical essay example document and saw maybe at most 4 or 5 words of that particular 5/6 sample essay.</p><p>But alas, I moved on with Bing Chat, the better version which I thought would do better with wordy tasks such as writing an essay.</p><h2 id=bing-chat-creative-version>Bing Chat (Creative Version)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bing-chat-creative-version>#</a></h2><p>Sure, I can try to rate your essay using the GRE scale. According to the GRE website1, the Analytical Writing measure tests your critical thinking and analytical writing skills. It assesses your ability to articulate and support complex ideas, construct and evaluate arguments, and sustain a focused and coherent discussion. It does not assess specific content knowledge.</p><p>The Analytical Writing measure consists of two separately timed analytical writing tasks:</p><ul><li>A 30-minute “Analyze an Issue” task</li><li>A 30-minute “Analyze an Argument” task</li></ul><p>The Issue task presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You are required to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views.</p><p>The Argument task requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.</p><p>The two tasks are complementary in that one requires you to construct your own argument by taking a position and providing evidence supporting your views on an issue, and the other requires you to evaluate someone else’s argument by assessing its claims and evaluating the evidence it provides.</p><p>Each essay is scored on a scale of 0-6 by at least one trained reader and by a computer program called e-rater. The scores are then averaged to produce a final score for each task. If the human and e-rater scores differ by more than one point, a second human reader is brought in to resolve the discrepancy.</p><p>The scoring for the essay is holistic, which means that graders base scores on an overall impression of your essay, rather than deducting specific points for errors. The score level descriptions for the Analytical Writing measure are as follows1:</p><ul><li>Score 6: Outstanding. Demonstrates superior analytical writing skills.</li><li>Score 5: Strong. Demonstrates clear competence in analytical writing skills.</li><li>Score 4: Adequate. Demonstrates satisfactory analytical writing skills.</li><li>Score 3: Limited. Demonstrates some competence in analytical writing skills, but with weaknesses.</li><li>Score 2: Seriously flawed. Demonstrates serious weaknesses in analytical writing skills.</li><li>Score 1: Fundamentally deficient. Demonstrates fundamental deficiencies in analytical writing skills.</li><li>Score 0: Unscorable. The essay is off-topic, written in a foreign language, consists of keystroke characters or merely copies the topic.</li></ul><p>Based on these criteria, I would rate your essay as follows:</p><ul><li>Score for the Issue task: 4</li><li>Score for the Argument task: N/A (not attempted)</li><li>Your essay on the Issue task demonstrates adequate analytical writing skills. You have presented a clear and coherent position on the topic and supported it with relevant reasons and examples. You have also considered some complexities and implications of the issue. However, your essay could be improved by addressing some of the following points:</li></ul><p>Your introduction could be more engaging and provide more context for the issue. You could also state your thesis more explicitly and preview your main points.</p><p>Your body paragraphs could be more organized and focused on one main idea each. You could also use more transitions and topic sentences to connect your ideas and guide your reader.</p><p>Your conclusion could be more effective by summarizing your main points, restating your thesis, and providing some implications or recommendations for further action or research on the issue.</p><p>Your language could be more precise and varied. You could avoid repetition, use synonyms, and choose words that convey your meaning more accurately and effectively.</p><p>Your grammar, spelling, and punctuation could be more accurate and consistent. You could proofread your essay carefully and correct any errors or typos.</p><p>I hope this feedback helps you improve your analytical writing skills. Thank you for using Bing! 😊</p><h2 id=my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-creative-version>My Thoughts on Bing Chat (Creative Version)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-creative-version>#</a></h2><p>So right off the bat, seeing a 4/6, and feeling uncharacteristically confident, coming off that dopamine high point to a more realistic trough of 4/6, it kinda stung a little bit, even though I knew deep inside that 5/6 was undeserved.</p><p>Because I didn&rsquo;t really put in much work for it.</p><p>And wouldn&rsquo;t that be a better story? Through the years of practicing my writing skills, I was able to effortlessly take my journaling/stream of consciousness writing skills to transition into the field of analytical writing.</p><p>But it seems focused practice still beats generalist practice and knowledge.</p><p>Anyways, I agreed with Bing Chat (Creative Version)&rsquo;s statements about my essay.</p><p>And I don&rsquo;t want to comment too much here because there&rsquo;s more.</p><h2 id=asking-bing-chat-creative-version-to-edit-my-essay>Asking Bing Chat (Creative Version) to Edit My Essay<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#asking-bing-chat-creative-version-to-edit-my-essay>#</a></h2><p>Sure, I can try to help you edit your essay to be 6/6. Here are some suggestions for improving your essay:</p><p>To make your introduction more engaging and provide more context for the issue, you could start with a hook that captures the reader’s attention and relates to the topic. For example, you could use a quote, a statistic, a question, or an anecdote that illustrates the importance of passion and curiosity in generating good ideas. You could also provide some background information on the issue, such as why it is relevant, controversial, or debatable. You could also state your thesis more explicitly and preview your main points. For example, you could say something like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>“The most powerful weapon is not a gun or a bomb, but an idea. Ideas have the potential to change the world, but where do they come from? How do people come up with good ideas that solve problems, create innovations, and inspire others? Some people might think that good ideas are the result of genius, luck, or inspiration. However, I believe that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. In this essay, I will explain why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas, how they help overcome challenges and difficulties, and how they lead to positive outcomes and impacts.”
</code></pre><p>To make your body paragraphs more organized and focused on one main idea each, you could use the following structure:</p><p>Topic sentence: Introduce the main idea of the paragraph and how it supports your thesis.</p><p>Explanation: Explain the main idea in more detail and provide examples or evidence.</p><p>Analysis: Analyze how the examples or evidence support your main idea and connect it to your thesis.</p><p>Transition: Connect the main idea of the paragraph to the next one.</p><p>For example, you could write something like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>“One reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help build fundamental knowledge and skills that are necessary for creative thinking. Passion is the motivation that drives people to learn more about their interests and hobbies, while curiosity is the desire to explore new possibilities and questions. By pursuing their passions and curiosities, people can acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to different domains and situations. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was passionate about painting, but he was also curious about anatomy, engineering, astronomy, and many other fields. He used his diverse knowledge and skills to create masterpieces of art and science that are still admired today. His passion and curiosity enabled him to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics and generate original and innovative ideas. Therefore, passion and curiosity are important for developing the foundation for good ideas.”
</code></pre><p>To make your conclusion more effective by summarizing your main points, restating your thesis, and providing some implications or recommendations for further action or research on the issue, you could use the following structure:</p><p>Summary: Summarize the main points of your essay and how they support your thesis.</p><p>Restatement: Restate your thesis in different words and emphasize its significance.</p><p>Implications: Discuss the implications or consequences of your thesis for the issue or for society in general.</p><p>Recommendations: Provide some suggestions or advice for how to foster passion and curiosity in oneself or others.</p><p>For example, you could write something like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>“In conclusion, I have argued that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. Passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas because they help build fundamental knowledge and skills, overcome challenges and difficulties, and lead to positive outcomes and impacts. Passion and curiosity are not innate traits that only some people possess, but rather habits of mind that can be cultivated and practiced by anyone. Therefore, I recommend that people should follow their passions and curiosities wherever they lead them, seek new experiences and perspectives, ask questions and challenge assumptions, and share their ideas with others. By doing so, they will not only enrich their own lives, but also contribute to the advancement of humanity.”

Thank you for using Bing! 😊</p><p>GRE Analytical Writing Measure</p><p>Here is the whole edited 6/6 essay:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>&#34;The most powerful weapon is not a gun or a bomb, but an idea. Ideas have the potential to change the world, but where do they come from? How do people come up with good ideas that solve problems, create innovations, and inspire others? Some people might think that good ideas are the result of genius, luck, or inspiration. However, I believe that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. In this essay, I will explain why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas, how they help overcome challenges and difficulties, and how they lead to positive outcomes and impacts.

One reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help build fundamental knowledge and skills that are necessary for creative thinking. Passion is the motivation that drives people to learn more about their interests and hobbies, while curiosity is the desire to explore new possibilities and questions. By pursuing their passions and curiosities, people can acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to different domains and situations. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was passionate about painting, but he was also curious about anatomy, engineering, astronomy, and many other fields. He used his diverse knowledge and skills to create masterpieces of art and science that are still admired today. His passion and curiosity enabled him to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics and generate original and innovative ideas. Therefore, passion and curiosity are important for developing the foundation for good ideas.

Another reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they help overcome challenges and difficulties that might otherwise discourage or prevent creative thinking. Passion is the fuel that keeps people going in the face of failure, rejection, or criticism, while curiosity is the spark that ignites new ideas and solutions. By having passion and curiosity, people can persist in their endeavors, experiment with different approaches, and learn from their mistakes. For example, Thomas Edison was passionate about inventing, but he was also curious about electricity, light, and sound. He faced many obstacles and failures in his quest to invent the lightbulb, but he never gave up. He tried over 1000 different materials for the filament until he found the right one. His passion and curiosity led him to discover not only the lightbulb, but also many other inventions that changed the world. Thus, passion and curiosity are essential for overcoming the challenges and difficulties of creative thinking.

A final reason why passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas is that they lead to positive outcomes and impacts that benefit not only the individual, but also society as a whole. Passion is the source of joy and fulfillment that comes from doing what one loves, while curiosity is the source of wonder and excitement that comes from discovering new things. By having passion and curiosity, people can enrich their own lives, as well as contribute to the advancement of humanity. For example, Marie Curie was passionate about science, but she was also curious about radioactivity. She devoted her life to studying this phenomenon, despite the risks and hardships she faced. She made groundbreaking discoveries that revolutionized physics and chemistry, as well as medicine and industry. Her passion and curiosity earned her two Nobel Prizes and a lasting legacy in history. Hence, passion and curiosity are important for creating positive outcomes and impacts from good ideas.

In conclusion, I have argued that the best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. Passion and curiosity are essential for generating good ideas because they help build fundamental knowledge and skills, overcome challenges and difficulties, and lead to positive outcomes and impacts. Passion and curiosity are not innate traits that only some people possess, but rather habits of mind that can be cultivated and practiced by anyone. Therefore, I recommend that people should follow their passions and curiosities wherever they lead them, seek new experiences and perspectives, ask questions and challenge assumptions, and share their ideas with others. By doing so, they will not only enrich their own lives, but also contribute to the advancement of humanity.&#34;

Here’s a revised version:</p><p>The Genesis of Great Ideas: A Passionate Interest in the Commonplace
Great ideas are often measured by their economic or scientific value. However, the genesis of these ideas invariably lies in the passionate interest of their creators, often rooted in commonplace things. This passion, coupled with a deep understanding of fundamental concepts, fuels the creation of ideas that may seem trivial in hindsight but are revolutionary in their impact.</p><p>Consider complex theories such as quantum mechanics and relativity. These theories, once considered esoteric, are now more accessible due to our improved understanding of their prerequisites and our ability to teach them comprehensively. Concepts like calculus and Newtonian physics, once the exclusive domain of scholars, are now taught in elementary schools, thanks to our grasp of fundamental knowledge like basic arithmetic and algebra.</p><p>Historically, this was not always the case. During the Middle Ages and even up to Newton’s era, only select monks in monasteries and affluent aristocrats were educated in basic algebra and arithmetic. The general populace was largely uneducated.</p><p>So, in the absence of this fundamental knowledge, how might a great idea be conceived? The answer lies in the passionate and curious examination of commonplace things. This passion fuels the inventor’s quest for knowledge, enabling them to connect the dots and produce great ideas.</p><p>In essence, the process of ideation is akin to connecting the dots between a series of commonplace knowledge. However, even with knowledge of the dots, finding the lines that connect them requires trial and error. This is where passion plays a crucial role. Passion provides the resilience to endure failures and persist in the face of adversity. As Thomas Edison famously said after inventing the lightbulb following 1000 unsuccessful attempts, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 1000 ways that won’t work.”</p><p>In conclusion, great ideas often arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things. This passion, coupled with a strong foundation of fundamental knowledge, enables the creator to endure failures and persevere in their quest for innovation.</p><p>This revised version maintains the original argument and examples but enhances clarity and coherence. It also corrects minor grammatical errors and improves sentence structure for better readability. Keep practicing and refining your writing skills! 😊</p><h2 id=my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-precise-versions-edits>My Thoughts on Bing Chat (Precise Version)&rsquo;s Edits<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-thoughts-on-bing-chat-precise-versions-edits>#</a></h2><p>So it took my words and my essay structure and switched them with big words from a thesaurus, mhm.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t mind it as a way of learning new words I guess. I know the context right away, so it&rsquo;s easier for me to understand the words if they are new.</p><p>So in conclusion, the key take away from this experiment is if you want to practice analytical writing, write and practice writing analytically.</p><p>But if you want to just write and have longevity in this craft as a hobby, or building the general fundamentals that you might need to practice analytical essay writing efficiently, I still recommend stream of consciousness writing.</p><p>You already have all the words in your head, put them down on the page, and that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ll write a piece on that sometime in the future, on the flow state, stream of consciousness, dopamine in the brain, letting go, meaning of life, all the good stuff.</p></div><footer
