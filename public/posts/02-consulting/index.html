Goal We know that every large goal starts off with a series of small goals. And even before that, every consequential result starts off with a concrete goal in mind. Actions that lead to that result only happen because of the pre-existence of that established goal.\nThe goal of this design document is to start a consultancy company. But more importantly, the goal of this experiment in starting a consultancy company is to learn the philosophy of consultancy and apply it to the struggles we have right now.\nSome of the issues that we have, if we just list them out right now are, social media addiction, game addiction, fear of missing out, fear of being left behind by the crowd, the fear of not even wanting to try, a crippling fear of trying, if you will.\nAnd the short sighted solution I see to tackle and solve all of those problems is to start a consultancy company. Because what are consultancy companies known for? They are known for solving problems. They might not have industry experience in a field, but they can use their general approach of solving problems to solve any customer’s problems.\nAnd perhaps it’s not even to solve the problems itself that the customer wants them to do, or pay them for. Perhaps the reason is the customer just wants the consultants to apply their consulting philosophy and approach on their problems, and give them a second opinion.\nWhy is that, and what is that consulting philosophy approach exactly?\nI think the consulting approach is to organize a problem, using charts, documents, slides, infographics, and present the already established information in such a way that it is easily digestible to the customer. Deliver the information regarding the problem in such a way that the customer can see a solution that they might have missed before.\nAnd why is that, the reason customers want to pay for such a consulting service is precisely because they are either fed up with a problem for too long that they don’t have the courage or the willpower anymore to do something supposedly trivial in their power to solve the problem, but hard in practice to actually do.\nAnd the consultants’ job is just to organize and present the information in such a way that it is easy for the customer to digest and make up their mind about a solution that they might already have in their subconscious, but afraid or for whatever reason, unable to externalize until they receive a second opinion.\nSometimes, a branded reputable source behind the plan can also help.\nSeeing a big name consultancy firm like McKinsey and Co. giving you a detailed plan on what you need to do might just help you be convinced to take the action required to solve your problems.\nAnd the solution to that problem the consultancy firm presents might even directly be information you told them during their interview process. But the fact the information came from them in the end, presented neatly on documents or powerpoint slides and infographic, might just convince you to finally take your own advice and make up your own mind about it.\nYou could say, a consultant is like a human rubber ducky, an invited audience, a professional field psychiatrist, or professional idea critic.\nBecause unlike yes-man’s, a consultant is still expected to give you correct advice even if you have incorrect ideas that you really want to pursue.\nAnd this part is where my philosophy of consultancy theory becomes deviant from real life consultant companies and how they operate.\nFor my purpose of “starting a consultancy” company, I simply want to organize my ideas, whims, ambitions, setbacks, and struggles that I have in my personal life, and look through them with an objective lens so I can better take action rather than sit back in dreadful procrastination and do nothing.\nOr worse yet, go with the flow of other people around me and society at large.\nBlindly following the advice of other people with different personal situations leads you to personal hells I have found.\nSo that could lead us to a new topic, or part 2, focus and scrutinize on the goal, starting a personal consultancy company for organizing your personal life.\nPart 2. Starting a Personal Consultancy Company For Organizing Your Personal Life You already know everything there is to know about your own life, or you, out of all the other people on this planet, have the strongest ability for gathering and understanding information about your own life.\nFor no other reason should you follow the advice of other people or seek out the advice of other people for what you should do or to inquire information from others about your own life. But we do it because we lack the ability or willpower to clean up the mess of information and organize the ocean of information we have so we can pinpoint on the details of what we actually need to know.\nA consultancy company needs to balance the density of information it presents to the customer with the amount of detail they need to know.\nIn practical terms, it is the amount of infographics, the amount of words the customer will read before they lose interest and fall asleep or focus on something else.\nReading and organizing information about our own lives is boring, and we quickly lose interest in doing so, and people hardly reflect on their own lives clearly for that reason.\nAnd since we already established in the first part of the essay that consultants don’t necessarily need to know the solution. And that often times a customer, upon seeing the information they might already know in an organized manner could lead to them acting on the solution that they might had already known but just didn’t feel confident enough to do it, we can conclude by organizing the information we already know about our own lives, we can find solutions and feel more confident to act on those solutions to our own problems.\nAnd we can also conclude, since customers trust information coming from a big name consultancy firm to be more trustworthy, and given more weight, we can trust to enact on the solution to our problems from a formal consulting process rather than simply thinking about what to do about our problems sitting alone in a field somewhere.\nSo that leads us to the next part, what can be a good formal consulting process for problems from our own lives, and its limitations, its extents, what do we even determine as problems worthy to be given thoughts and a formal consulting process to, and the differences between a professional consulting process at a professional consulting company and the professional consulting process at a personal consultancy company.\nPart 3. Formal Consulting Process At A Personal Consulting Company Writing is flawed. Writing is like telling stories, and with enough time passing the stories within the writing on through writers and speakers, the information on the truth gets distorted.\nWhich is why I love telling personal stories and I think is a big reason why people love telling personal stories in general.\nYou can trust a personal story to be true even if you had personal experience that goes against it.\nYou can at least trust it happened.\nYou can at least treat it with a grain of salt, and be convinced that the storyteller had purposely or unintentionally left out details that led your own personal experience to goes against it or be different in general.\nAnd this takes away some responsibility of the storyteller.\nThe storyteller doesn’t have to tell you, that “this is not financial advice” or “this is not legal advice” and doesn’t get sued, because this is not advice, this is just a story, for entertainment purposes, of something that may or may not have happened in our reality.\nAnd if it didn’t or even if it did, it’s missing some truths that both the listener and the storyteller doesn’t fully understand.\nReality is an infinitely complex game of near infinitely small parts interacting with each other in infinite entropy.\nSo in this draft, and this story, I will attempt to come up with a formal consulting process for a personal consulting company.\nFirst, you as the consulting and the customer of the consulting company must determine the problems and solutions of the problems that you determine as being worthy to solve.\nYou can have many problems you don’t deem worthy to solve. And you can have information crucial to solving the problems you do deem worthy to solve because you don’t deem it worthy to provide to yourself that information.\nIt could be gas-lighting. You could be gas-lighting yourself.\nBut it very could be unconscious gas-lighting, if you truly have your own best interests at heart and you don’t want to give yourself that information.\nSo before we list out the information and the methods of formal consulting for personal use, we must ensure that we ourselves are as transparent to ourselves as possible, and have our own best intentions at heart.\nWe cannot go into a personal consulting process if we hate ourselves or have parts of ourselves we are afraid to ask questions about or afraid to open up and understand.\nThen secondly, we write.\nFirst it will be a brainstorm, we will write as much as we can, and maybe that will be the last draft, because all writings are true and good enough if they are sincere enough.\nWe will write about all that we know about ourselves, our problems, and our current state.\nFor example, the problem could be writer’s block, and not wanting writer’s block and attempting to find a solution to beat writer’s block.\nThe personal consulting company can then write about what is writer’s block, and write about all the reasons for causing writer’s block, and all the reasons that you as the customer think have effects on causing the writer’s block.\nBecause you know what it is.\nAnd if you don’t, Google it.\nGoogle, what is writer’s block?\nAnd the information that you can’t Google, that is the information you need to find by looking inwards, and interview the customer for.\nThings that only you yourself would know. Maybe it’s that smoking habit. Maybe it’s that gaming habit. Maybe every time you write you think to play video games, or watch YouTube, so maybe the problem is not a writer’s block problem, but a content addiction problem.\nAnd how do you verify that?\nThrough experiments.\nConduct tests and record data to fill charts on yourself.\nOf your problems and your attempts at living your life and solving your problems.\nBut another thing to note is that oftentimes when you are being aware of yourself and recording yourself while you are performing the action, it can have an effect on your actions.\nYou might, through the process of viewing yourself when attempting to write, cause you more harm in trying to simply write.\nSo it is good to record from a secondary source, such as using a video camera, or keep track of the time it takes for you to solve a problem. And review the footage after the fact, and devote 100% of your attention while attempting to solve the problem to solving the problem.\nLastly, this is very meta, because I am both writing about how to enact a formal consulting process through a formal consulting process. This period of writing has been a formal consulting process. And I have noticed that my paragraphs went from formal dense paragraphs of maybe 6 lines long to short conversational 1 liners.\nAnd there are still so much to write. Writing does get easier one you open the floodgate of ideas. And as your brain swims with dopamine, and you get into a near manic state, similar to flow, you will find it easier and easier to write, and harder to stop.\nUltimately writing is like a conversation, and the only structure is the prosodies of your words, like in poetry, like in theater, and unlike a formal structured piece of technical writing, where you have to have everything planned out from the start.\nAttribute a section to the installation instructions, a section to listing out all the parts that come with your machine, a part to liabilities, a part to the company website should the user have more inquiries.\nThose sections are harder to fill up, than if you just told someone to drive there to the house and verbally tell the customer all that information, where in that case the information will likely not be delivered in an organized way that follows the sections sequentially.\nYou might tell a little bit about the warranty first, and then the hardest part to install, and then make sure the customer has all the parts.\nAnd the thing that is true in such a conversation is not even really the words, but the way the words are delivered and the rhythm, the prosody behind the words, and the attitude and body language those words are delivered.\nWhich is what you need to be mindful of in a formal personal consulting process to not gas-light yourself or cope yourself into doing things you don’t want to do, or want to do but really shouldn’t.\nTo tie it back to the topic, sometimes you already know what you need but you already know you don’t want to do it.\nAnd in that case it is a matter of why, and a much more philosophical discovery into what you should do.\nWe all die someday, and if you are reading this, count 80 years from when you were born, and that is approximately when you would die, in the year 2023 as I’m writing this, and in North America at least, that’s when you would likely die as that is the likely average in 2023 at least.\nSo you shouldn’t be afraid of where you will end up, because compared to that, everything is short term and most things have relatively no long term consequences.\nPractice your religion, be ready for your long term, and analyze your short term goals with those lenses.\nAnd originally the purpose of this design document was to simply write out a way to take notes. But then it became more a practice of comfort and convenience piece in how to write essays in markdown format, and then became a potential blog, a potential novel, story with no liable legal consequences, and became harder and harder to talk about the exact structure in how to write a formal consulting process in markdown, the physical and practical mechanics of it.\nAnyways the thing I wanted to say was you could have a goal, and you could have all the information in the world that help you identify exactly what you need to do to achieve that goal.\nBut you will still end up not doing it, because you feel it somewhere deep in your heart, and you’re not sure of the exact reason, and maybe you’re sure that any reason you come up with, will be reasons after the fact, and only appear as justifications to that already existing feeling you feel so strongly of.\nSomehow deep in your heart, and your subconscious that makes up everything about you, you feel and know that you don’t want to do this thing and don’t want this result or the actions necessary towards getting this result to become your reality, so you strongly feel you shouldn’t do it.\nAnd so you don’t.\nAnd you should not do it.\nBecause it is not a dream from your heart, it is probably a dream from your mind, and your heart sees through that and can already tell you that it is a scam.\nAnd we already have too little time, infinity minus 80 years too short of time on this planet and in this universe to waste ourselves to do something that our heart doesn’t want to do.\nSo you should write something in markdown, in powerpoint, and do something that fills your brain with energy and dopamine and chase after those goals from your heart that you can do and also not feel terrible about yourself in tomorrow.\nIn conclusion, the formal consulting process towards your own life is that you already have the best sources in the world for your own life. You already have all the information you need to live your own best life. And the only reason why you would feel you need to consult a consulting firm to fix your life is something that you already know better than the consulting firms. And still, the you feel the need to and you know the reason already, is because you’re swimming in too much information, and you need something like a consulting firm to organize your life, and the information you already know for you to finally able to see all your knowledge in a way you want to see it as. And that’s what consulting firms and the formal personal consulting process is better than you at, and also the reason it is for, which is to organize your knowledge.\n","wordCount":"2884","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-09-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-09-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Written by Yohannes Zhou"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/posts/02-consulting/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yohannes' Tech Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://github.com/youhengzhou title="yohannes' github"><span>yohannes' github</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to start a consultancy company</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-09-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Written by Yohannes Zhou</div></header><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=/blog/images/02/snowstorm.jpg#center alt=img></p><h2 id=part-1-goal>Part 1.

Formal Consulting Process At A Personal Consulting Company<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#part-3-formal-consulting-process-at-a-personal-consulting-company>#</a></h2><p>Writing is flawed. Writing is like telling stories, and with enough time passing the stories within the writing on through writers and speakers, the information on the truth gets distorted.</p><p>Which is why I love telling personal stories and I think is a big reason why people love telling personal stories in general.</p><p>You can trust a personal story to be true even if you had personal experience that goes against it.</p><p>You can at least trust it happened.</p><p>You can at least treat it with a grain of salt, and be convinced that the storyteller had purposely or unintentionally left out details that led your own personal experience to goes against it or be different in general.</p><p>And this takes away some responsibility of the storyteller.</p><p>The storyteller doesn&rsquo;t have to tell you, that &ldquo;this is not financial advice&rdquo; or &ldquo;this is not legal advice&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t get sued, because this is not advice, this is just a story, for entertainment purposes, of something that may or may not have happened in our reality.</p><p>And if it didn&rsquo;t or even if it did, it&rsquo;s missing some truths that both the listener and the storyteller doesn&rsquo;t fully understand.</p><p>Reality is an infinitely complex game of near infinitely small parts interacting with each other in infinite entropy.</p><p>So in this draft, and this story, I will attempt to come up with a formal consulting process for a personal consulting company.</p><p>First, you as the consulting and the customer of the consulting company must determine the problems and solutions of the problems that you determine as being worthy to solve.</p><p>You can have many problems you don&rsquo;t deem worthy to solve. And you can have information crucial to solving the problems you do deem worthy to solve because you don&rsquo;t deem it worthy to provide to yourself that information.</p><p>It could be gas-lighting. You could be gas-lighting yourself.</p><p>But it very could be unconscious gas-lighting, if you truly have your own best interests at heart and you don&rsquo;t want to give yourself that information.</p><p>So before we list out the information and the methods of formal consulting for personal use, we must ensure that we ourselves are as transparent to ourselves as possible, and have our own best intentions at heart.</p><p>We cannot go into a personal consulting process if we hate ourselves or have parts of ourselves we are afraid to ask questions about or afraid to open up and understand.</p><p>Then secondly, we write.</p><p>First it will be a brainstorm, we will write as much as we can, and maybe that will be the last draft, because all writings are true and good enough if they are sincere enough.</p><p>We will write about all that we know about ourselves, our problems, and our current state.</p><p>For example, the problem could be writer&rsquo;s block, and not wanting writer&rsquo;s block and attempting to find a solution to beat writer&rsquo;s block.</p><p>The personal consulting company can then write about what is writer&rsquo;s block, and write about all the reasons for causing writer&rsquo;s block, and all the reasons that you as the customer think have effects on causing the writer&rsquo;s block.</p><p>Because you know what it is.</p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t, Google it.</p><p>Google, what is writer&rsquo;s block?</p><p>And the information that you can&rsquo;t Google, that is the information you need to find by looking inwards, and interview the customer for.</p><p>Things that only you yourself would know. Maybe it&rsquo;s that smoking habit. Maybe it&rsquo;s that gaming habit. Maybe every time you write you think to play video games, or watch YouTube, so maybe the problem is not a writer&rsquo;s block problem, but a content addiction problem.</p><p>And how do you verify that?</p><p>Through experiments.</p><p>Conduct tests and record data to fill charts on yourself.</p><p>Of your problems and your attempts at living your life and solving your problems.</p><p>But another thing to note is that oftentimes when you are being aware of yourself and recording yourself while you are performing the action, it can have an effect on your actions.</p><p>You might, through the process of viewing yourself when attempting to write, cause you more harm in trying to simply write.</p><p>So it is good to record from a secondary source, such as using a video camera, or keep track of the time it takes for you to solve a problem. And review the footage after the fact, and devote 100% of your attention while attempting to solve the problem to solving the problem.</p><p>Lastly, this is very meta, because I am both writing about how to enact a formal consulting process through a formal consulting process. This period of writing has been a formal consulting process. And I have noticed that my paragraphs went from formal dense paragraphs of maybe 6 lines long to short conversational 1 liners.</p><p>And there are still so much to write. Writing does get easier one you open the floodgate of ideas. And as your brain swims with dopamine, and you get into a near manic state, similar to flow, you will find it easier and easier to write, and harder to stop.</p><p>Ultimately writing is like a conversation, and the only structure is the prosodies of your words, like in poetry, like in theater, and unlike a formal structured piece of technical writing, where you have to have everything planned out from the start.</p><p>Attribute a section to the installation instructions, a section to listing out all the parts that come with your machine, a part to liabilities, a part to the company website should the user have more inquiries.</p><p>Those sections are harder to fill up, than if you just told someone to drive there to the house and verbally tell the customer all that information, where in that case the information will likely not be delivered in an organized way that follows the sections sequentially.</p><p>You might tell a little bit about the warranty first, and then the hardest part to install, and then make sure the customer has all the parts.</p><p>And the thing that is true in such a conversation is not even really the words, but the way the words are delivered and the rhythm, the prosody behind the words, and the attitude and body language those words are delivered.</p><p>Which is what you need to be mindful of in a formal personal consulting process to not gas-light yourself or cope yourself into doing things you don&rsquo;t want to do, or want to do but really shouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>To tie it back to the topic, sometimes you already know what you need but you already know you don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p><p>And in that case it is a matter of why, and a much more philosophical discovery into what you should do.</p><p>We all die someday, and if you are reading this, count 80 years from when you were born, and that is approximately when you would die, in the year 2023 as I&rsquo;m writing this, and in North America at least, that&rsquo;s when you would likely die as that is the likely average in 2023 at least.</p><p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of where you will end up, because compared to that, everything is short term and most things have relatively no long term consequences.</p><p>Practice your religion, be ready for your long term, and analyze your short term goals with those lenses.</p><p>And originally the purpose of this design document was to simply write out a way to take notes. But then it became more a practice of comfort and convenience piece in how to write essays in markdown format, and then became a potential blog, a potential novel, story with no liable legal consequences, and became harder and harder to talk about the exact structure in how to write a formal consulting process in markdown, the physical and practical mechanics of it.</p><p>Anyways the thing I wanted to say was you could have a goal, and you could have all the information in the world that help you identify exactly what you need to do to achieve that goal.</p><p>But you will still end up not doing it, because you feel it somewhere deep in your heart, and you&rsquo;re not sure of the exact reason, and maybe you&rsquo;re sure that any reason you come up with, will be reasons after the fact, and only appear as justifications to that already existing feeling you feel so strongly of.</p><p>Somehow deep in your heart, and your subconscious that makes up everything about you, you feel and know that you don&rsquo;t want to do this thing and don&rsquo;t want this result or the actions necessary towards getting this result to become your reality, so you strongly feel you shouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p><p>And so you don&rsquo;t.</p><p>And you should not do it.</p><p>Because it is not a dream from your heart, it is probably a dream from your mind, and your heart sees through that and can already tell you that it is a scam.</p><p>And we already have too little time, infinity minus 80 years too short of time on this planet and in this universe to waste ourselves to do something that our heart doesn&rsquo;t want to do.</p><p>So you should write something in markdown, in powerpoint, and do something that fills your brain with energy and dopamine and chase after those goals from your heart that you can do and also not feel terrible about yourself in tomorrow.</p><p>In conclusion, the formal consulting process towards your own life is that you already have the best sources in the world for your own life. You already have all the information you need to live your own best life. And the only reason why you would feel you need to consult a consulting firm to fix your life is something that you already know better than the consulting firms. And still, the you feel the need to and you know the reason already, is because you&rsquo;re swimming in too much information, and you need something like a consulting firm to organize your life, and the information you already know for you to finally able to see all your knowledge in a way you want to see it as. And that&rsquo;s what consulting firms and the formal personal consulting process is better than you at, and also the reason it is for, which is to organize your knowledge.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/posts/03-best-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things</span></a>
