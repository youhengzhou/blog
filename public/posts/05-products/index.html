Shedd that goes, “A ship in a habour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.” Which is another way of saying we need to break out of comfort zones “harbor” for great things to happen “exploration, traveling.” In the same spirit, a blog without content is safe and a page without words is safe. But we can’t create great art, leave lasting legacies, and reach our fulfillments of our immediate goals and self actualization at large.\nI want to start this blog by presenting the following:\nThis is my Google Analytics chart that I took today. I had recently added Google Analytics the day before yesterday, before I dropped my last blog, on how over-reliance on reading can dull your independent creative mind.\nAnd the point I want to raise from this image is simple. How do we measure success? I was happy when I saw the image. I saw 11 organic traffic viewers from Canada, 4 from Ireland (somebody using a VPN?) and 1 from Hong Kong.\nAnd I had some interesting feedback and conversations that rose out of the blog.\nThe Feedback [anonymous] — Today at 11:11 PM firstly, this post was beautifully written jones!\nsecondly, I am inclined to concur with your chief assertation; reading only dilutes the natural ebb and flow of the human mind.\nthirdly, I am also inclined to admit the funny little paradox this puts me in: my mind’s undisturbed thoughts have been altered, dare I say - disturbed - after reading your article… which ones are my own? which ones have been covertly manipulated ever so slightly such that I believe them to have been conjured up by me but in truth have alien origins?\nMy Response Yohannes — Today at 11:27 PM thank you for your thoughtful feedback [anonymous]!\nto your third point, I would say, before we attempt anything, we must win the battle of becoming ourselves. I think the issue you raised with my blog of whether over-reading is a bad thing is not simply exactly on whether over-reading is a bad thing but how to be sure which thoughts are your own. Which is the overarching point that my blog touches but did not discuss directly.\nI think in all the different kinds of human communities, we adopt the thought patterns of our co-habitants, and goes to that old saying “show me 5 of your friends you speak to the most, and I’ll show you where you are in 30 years”. We can’t help ourselves to become like others around us, especially close ones, being by nature sociable creatures who takes the best features of our surroundings, and conceding problematic parts of ourselves into adopting and sharing life with others around us without overstepping them.\nThe larger problem rises in sharing a community that is larger than the sum of its parts, our hyper global and modern community does not really take into account of adopting to our own local individual nuances, and makes no effort or need to make effort in adopting to ourselves. However, we must be the ones to adopt to the cultural norms of our thoughts leaders, ever so forthright in front of us on our screens, YouTube, Instagram, our digital third spaces, where we idle our thoughts. We were influenced from a young age by these community forces on what we should be, what we should strive for, what we should feel sad on if we doesn’t conform to, what we should work on, and from a community of values where adoption is one way. We must change ourselves to accommodate the world, and not the other way around.\nThe solution I believe is not to grow increasingly fragmented as a counter-swing, becoming more independent in personal opinions and culture, but to find and nurture our own localized communities whether that’s digital or physical.\nAnalysis I think it is a bit of an alarming pattern to hear from many of my readers such as [anonymous] that they encounter this problem of “losing themselves”, and not simply in books or media, but in our media driven society in general.\nMedia and information is readily available. One could watch more than a lifetime worth of documentaries on any number of subjects from Space to Technology. One can also watch more than a lifetime worth of advertisements, Instagram reels,\nI try to be partial and not jump on a fixed vector polarity of values matrix towards a solution, because I believe the problem with not fitting in to the culture identity here is multi-faceted.\nAnd I think it could be broken down into three parts, which I will tackle separately, and that is Products, perfectionism, and process.\nPart 1. Products The end goal of a ship docked in a harbor is to eventually reach a destination across the sea.\nThe end goal of this formerly empty page is to become an art piece of writing, develop ideas, develop aesthetics of prosody in the prose while congruent with the maintaining a truthful structure to the development of the idea, and being interesting enough in humor or succinctness to convey a number of thought to the reader, and spur willingness for the reader to develop more thoughts of their own, and complete the highest stage of fulfillment on the pyramid of needs, which is external-actualization.\nBecause as we paint our ideas over the world around us, we become a bit more robust if not entirely spiritually immortal. In the same way if having progeny means being physically immortal.\nAnd in this large global community of shared values, we follow our influencers and thoughts leaders as role models of community values to become something.\nBecause we do lose a bit of our identity when in a community, or placed in any external environment.\nIf you live close to the ocean, you find yourself starting to have thoughts of trying to learn surfing. If you live close to the mountains, you could naturally develop an affection for hiking.\nIt is what’s both convenient to us, and natural, more energy efficient overall towards fulfilling our pyramid of needs as we make conciliatory sacrifices towards our environment, and that includes the people we spend the most of our times with.\nThe end goal of this journey, the analogous ship sailing out of the harbor, feeling angst at sitting in port for so long, the same way we feel when we notice our shape in the mirror doesn’t match the contours of our role models on our screens, and sailing out to work and do something about it.\nWe turn our body into something else through work, into a product. A product because this effective force of transformation is one way. There is no haggling. We make a product and we put online anonymously, or through tampered for buyers to purchase with social credits of the global community’s approved validation.\nWe can’t change the standards. We can’t change the demands of our customers. We try to create the best product to find the best buyers.\nPart 2. Perfectionism But thankfully, this product ideal is not enforced by draconian gatekeepers. I believe our global society is very tolerant, and more tolerance towards our individualities is something our global society is trying to work towards.\nOur society does have our best intention at heart, despite the challenges.\nBut this idea of “you should be yourself” and celebrating individuality instead of trying to gut ourselves to become the ideal doesn’t quite reach our ears despite it being something also actively pushed in our media.\nWe seem to have this innate idea of perfectionism built into all of us, that goes against all the popular advice of “money doesn’t buy you happiness” or “you should not compare yourself to others”. We still compete, and see competition, and still see the dreaded fear of missing out, young people who are sad at a lack of meaning, feeling they are not enough. It doesn’t seem to be as simple as broadcasting the message of “you’re enough” and self love to the world.\nWhen trying to start this blog I had ran into the same issue. I know full well that I don’t have to create something worthy of publishing on medium or be made into a collection novel of essays on my first try. I know full well that simply writing anything is better than nothing. Yet I run into writer’s block. I run into scraping my works, rephrasing myself so it fit my idea of what is good in the “social standard”. This process of self censorship, similar to rephrasing ourselves to make ourselves more clear to our friends when it came to a subject of expertise where you and your friend has different levels of. This process of re-phrasing is exacerbated to extreme levels of discomfort when it came to the expectations of society at large.\nSomewhere deep inside we feel we know what we want to say. We can see the filtering lens of perfection clearly, holding it in our hands. But we can’t cut out a piece of work that passes through it in one pass. We pour our work through it, over and over, chipping away pieces, scrapping away parts as the process goes on until the whole thing passes through.\nTrying to solve this one way puzzle, given a goal that we cannot change, a maze we must navigate but can’t suggest to move the walls of, this standard our product must fulfil, that is stern and unmoving, becoming a standard of perfection.\nAnd the way to attain that perfection, despite the futility we may see before we start, is in the same harbor our ships are docked before we leave port, the empty page before any words rendered it sullied.\nThere are indeed many different stages or different kinds perfections altogether. The way to combat this feeling of existential dread against our very spirit being unclean and imperfect against the perfection of an unmoving community ideal on our screens is to seek out our own local communities and find local perfections. That both ourselves and our communities around us can seek to pursue and attain.\nPart 3. Process The way forward is to find the state of “perfection” closest to you. Within your reach, this next word, this next letter, this next idea, thought, flicker of your synapses. Towards something multitudes greater.\nThe nuances here is there is a path amongst the trees of goals and “perfections” for you to attain. Somewhere beyond there is a clearing, where you can see from far away. You move from tree to tree towards that clearing. Sometimes you make a bad decision, and goes towards a tree slightly further from the clearing. But that is okay. You keep that general direction in your mind, even in the deepest part of the forest where you do not see to the clearing beyond. You keep that direction in your head, supplementing it as an image over the different trees, the different paths you take.\nHow might this choice of moving to a different country gets you closer to your overarching goal, your community’s idea of “perfection”? How might buying or selling this stock, writing or penning this blog, learning about this technology, writing this sentence, searching up information about this book leads towards it? Every action itself is perfection. And every action itself has a comparative direction towards that far goal in the distance.\nThat is what you must do as a forest navigator to not get lost in the woods.\nDon’t choose to stop, thinking this is futility, that the clearing can never be reached. Who knows what the social ideals of society would be, tomorrow it is something else. And even if you know it very well today, put it onto words, have 100k followers, in direct metrics, can you see the paths in the woods that leads to that clearing?\nIt’s hard for anybody to see a surefire path in the woods that leads to having 100k followers on Instagram. But if that’s really what you want, you will find trees that look like they could lead to that clearing, if not the most optimal path. You learn how the algorithm works. You work a 9 to 5, save enough money to hire a professional photographer, professional stylist. If you don’t have the communication skills, practice in front of a mirror, visit a professional speech therapist, get professional coaching. You learn how to write cold emails, how to network with other influencers starting from how to make small talk with the cashier.\nIf you want to reach the clearing bad enough, if you live in close proximity to a community that has its values in reaching that clearing staunchly enough, you will feel the will to reach those immediate trees.\nBut make sure the desire is not so strong that it makes you lust for a tree that is across a cliff.\nDo not take grand steps you cannot make.\nMake incremental goals towards your immediate local perfections.\nAnd the problem lies not in the feasibility of reaching the clearing itself.\nThe problem lies in the being rushed.\nWhere the clearing is being replaced by the tree.\nWe only see the shoulders of giants. We do not know where they are headed, the challenges they are currently undertaking, and we don’t see the body of work they have accumulated.\nOur clearings should be in a direction close along the directions of path we have accumulated.\nThe things we are good at, go make them better. Find something close by that validates and empowers them. Take them to the next level.\nThere are no lies and unrealistic or unfeasible on our social media, and if there are, it doesn’t matter. Life is transient. The purpose of a unrealistic goal is not to attain it, but have a direction where all your immediate goals point to, to have something to do.\nOtherwise, every impulse, every thought, whims, it all leads back in a circle.\nTowards drugs, towards doom, because distance is how we measure happiness.\nFrom safety to self-actualization to painting the world in your colors. We seek more and more. Go further and further, until and before we run out of fuel and close our eyes permanently, meaningless and thus all are equally meaningful.\nJust make sure your immediate next step is not the moon, but the wrench or textbook closest to your textbook, where in it you can see you moon. And you dream of the moon through your tools, where whether you get there or not doesn’t matter at all.\n","wordCount":"2449","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/images/05/img.jpg","datePublished":"2023-09-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-09-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Written by Yohannes Zhou"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/posts/05-products/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yohannes' Tech Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://youhengzhou.github.io/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-1LQHF9SW0V"></script>

I believe our global society is very tolerant, and more tolerance towards our individualities is something our global society is trying to work towards.</p><p>Our society does have our best intention at heart, despite the challenges.</p><p>But this idea of &ldquo;you should be yourself&rdquo; and celebrating individuality instead of trying to gut ourselves to become the ideal doesn&rsquo;t quite reach our ears despite it being something also actively pushed in our media.</p><p>We seem to have this innate idea of perfectionism built into all of us, that goes against all the popular advice of &ldquo;money doesn&rsquo;t buy you happiness&rdquo; or &ldquo;you should not compare yourself to others&rdquo;. We still compete, and see competition, and still see the dreaded fear of missing out, young people who are sad at a lack of meaning, feeling they are not enough. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as simple as broadcasting the message of &ldquo;you&rsquo;re enough&rdquo; and self love to the world.</p><p>When trying to start this blog I had ran into the same issue. I know full well that I don&rsquo;t have to create something worthy of publishing on medium or be made into a collection novel of essays on my first try. I know full well that simply writing anything is better than nothing. Yet I run into writer&rsquo;s block. I run into scraping my works, rephrasing myself so it fit my idea of what is good in the &ldquo;social standard&rdquo;. This process of self censorship, similar to rephrasing ourselves to make ourselves more clear to our friends when it came to a subject of expertise where you and your friend has different levels of. This process of re-phrasing is exacerbated to extreme levels of discomfort when it came to the expectations of society at large.</p><p>Somewhere deep inside we feel we know what we want to say. We can see the filtering lens of perfection clearly, holding it in our hands. But we can&rsquo;t cut out a piece of work that passes through it in one pass. We pour our work through it, over and over, chipping away pieces, scrapping away parts as the process goes on until the whole thing passes through.</p><p>Trying to solve this one way puzzle, given a goal that we cannot change, a maze we must navigate but can&rsquo;t suggest to move the walls of, this standard our product must fulfil, that is stern and unmoving, becoming a standard of perfection.</p><p>And the way to attain that perfection, despite the futility we may see before we start, is in the same harbor our ships are docked before we leave port, the empty page before any words rendered it sullied.</p><p>There are indeed many different stages or different kinds perfections altogether. The way to combat this feeling of existential dread against our very spirit being unclean and imperfect against the perfection of an unmoving community ideal on our screens is to seek out our own local communities and find local perfections. That both ourselves and our communities around us can seek to pursue and attain.</p><h2 id=part-3-process>Part 3. Process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#part-3-process>#</a></h2><p>The way forward is to find the state of &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; closest to you. Within your reach, this next word, this next letter, this next idea, thought, flicker of your synapses. Towards something multitudes greater.</p><p>The nuances here is there is a path amongst the trees of goals and &ldquo;perfections&rdquo; for you to attain. Somewhere beyond there is a clearing, where you can see from far away. You move from tree to tree towards that clearing. Sometimes you make a bad decision, and goes towards a tree slightly further from the clearing. But that is okay. You keep that general direction in your mind, even in the deepest part of the forest where you do not see to the clearing beyond. You keep that direction in your head, supplementing it as an image over the different trees, the different paths you take.</p><p>How might this choice of moving to a different country gets you closer to your overarching goal, your community&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;perfection&rdquo;? How might buying or selling this stock, writing or penning this blog, learning about this technology, writing this sentence, searching up information about this book leads towards it? Every action itself is perfection. And every action itself has a comparative direction towards that far goal in the distance.</p><p>That is what you must do as a forest navigator to not get lost in the woods.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t choose to stop, thinking this is futility, that the clearing can never be reached. Who knows what the social ideals of society would be, tomorrow it is something else. And even if you know it very well today, put it onto words, have 100k followers, in direct metrics, can you see the paths in the woods that leads to that clearing?</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard for anybody to see a surefire path in the woods that leads to having 100k followers on Instagram. But if that&rsquo;s really what you want, you will find trees that look like they could lead to that clearing, if not the most optimal path. You learn how the algorithm works. You work a 9 to 5, save enough money to hire a professional photographer, professional stylist. If you don&rsquo;t have the communication skills, practice in front of a mirror, visit a professional speech therapist, get professional coaching. You learn how to write cold emails, how to network with other influencers starting from how to make small talk with the cashier.</p><p>If you want to reach the clearing bad enough, if you live in close proximity to a community that has its values in reaching that clearing staunchly enough, you will feel the will to reach those immediate trees.</p><p>But make sure the desire is not so strong that it makes you lust for a tree that is across a cliff.</p><p>Do not take grand steps you cannot make.</p><p>Make incremental goals towards your immediate local perfections.</p><p>And the problem lies not in the feasibility of reaching the clearing itself.</p><p>The problem lies in the being rushed.</p><p>Where the clearing is being replaced by the tree.</p><p>We only see the shoulders of giants. We do not know where they are headed, the challenges they are currently undertaking, and we don&rsquo;t see the body of work they have accumulated.</p><p>Our clearings should be in a direction close along the directions of path we have accumulated.</p><p>The things we are good at, go make them better. Find something close by that validates and empowers them. Take them to the next level.</p><p>There are no lies and unrealistic or unfeasible on our social media, and if there are, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Life is transient. The purpose of a unrealistic goal is not to attain it, but have a direction where all your immediate goals point to, to have something to do.</p><p>Otherwise, every impulse, every thought, whims, it all leads back in a circle.</p><p>Towards drugs, towards doom, because distance is how we measure happiness.</p><p>From safety to self-actualization to painting the world in your colors. We seek more and more. Go further and further, until and before we run out of fuel and close our eyes permanently, meaningless and thus all are equally meaningful.</p><p>Just make sure your immediate next step is not the moon, but the wrench or textbook closest to your textbook, where in it you can see you moon. And you dream of the moon through your tools, where whether you get there or not doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/blog/images/05/moon.jpg#center alt=img></p></div><footer
